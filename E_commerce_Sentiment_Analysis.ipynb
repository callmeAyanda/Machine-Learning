            "--------------------------------------------------\n",
            "i bought the deep maroon which is beautiful absolutely love the softness length and the casual look you can dress it up and dress it down it does run big i got the medium but could wear the small easily enough since i am 6 feet tall i wanted to length to be where it is the only part i did not like is the 34 length sleeves as it is tough when wearing a jacket over it\n",

            "i truly cannot understand the great reviews on this dress i purchased in both a sp and a mp i am 52 120 the mp fit perfectly i definitely wouldnt keep it though because it looks like someone sewed a bunch of old sweatshirts together its not super soft coarse on the inside and feels old the back is longer than the front it just looks like something my daughter would make in sewing class out of scraps even with leggings and great boots it looks worn\n",

            "i ordered this blouse as a gift for my mom it is too pricey to live up to my expectations it is quite sheer and the hem of the sleeves are unfinished which you cant see in the pictures this makes a very expensive blouse look cheap it is made of viscose and dry clean only the material used is not on par with the price in my opinion if it had been real silk or another natural fiber ok but for me this and the unfinished hem along with the price is a deal breaker for me\n",

            "--------------------------------------------------\n",
            "my perspective is as a sewer so im more picky perhaps this top is poorly made the fabric pattern is crooked or not consistent in each piece sewers do this to save squeezing the pieces on the fabric it looks sloppy the cut is very full the bottom edge measures 104 around for my figure curvey at 56 and 150lbs this top is not flattering it looks maternity perhaps best on a slim figure and with leggings\n",

            "absolutely love the diagonal zipper it is extremely flattering for the office and comfortable a great layering piece with a simple blazer or alone looks high quality my only one minor complaint is that the bottom tends to move away from my body as the top is wide on the bottom hence gives you a lot of leeway in the stomach area may not be a good thing or may be a good thing still overall a keeper\n",
            "--------------------------------------------------\n",
